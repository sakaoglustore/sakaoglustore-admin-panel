## How to Deploy to Production
1. Update the production URL in `src/config.js` with your actual API domain
2. Build the application with `npm run build`
3. Deploy the build folder to your hosting service

## PDF Processing Notes
The system now extracts order IDs from PDF files with the following logic:
- All MongoDB ObjectId format strings (24 character hex) are detected
- Order IDs are matched against existing pending orders
- Multiple orders in a single PDF are processed in parallel
- A concise success summary is shown after processing

## Best Practices
1. Always test PDF upload with real PDFs before production use
2. Ensure the MongoDB order IDs are clearly visible in the PDF
3. Check API endpoints in the config file before deployment
4. Consider implementing additional security measures for file uploads in production
